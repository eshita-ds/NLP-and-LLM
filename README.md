</td>
    <td> This project was focussed on building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that uses pre-trained OpenAI model to process and answer user queries based on uploaded PDF documents. The implementation required leveraging LangChain and a vector database (ChromaDB) to index and retrieve information from the PDFs. </td>

    <td>The project involved using OpenAI API and Langchain to create a chatbot that is capable of handling a sequence of chats and ability summarize the entire chat at the end of the session. The tasks involved solving a complex Maths problem, parse a PDF or Website and answer questions about the content or combine information from multiple sources and provide intelligent responses. </td>

    <td><b>Code understanding and Context aware chatbot using Langchain and OpenAI</b></td>
    <td>The project involved focuses on building a code understanding model that allows users to upload custom code files and ask context-based questions about them. It also explores the ability for a chatbot to have iterative conversations using Custom text data or multiple documents. It also utilizes the ability to store chats in memory and provide a summary at the end of the session.</td>
