      "**Integers:**\n",
      "Integers are positive and negative whole numbers. When you perform math operations on integers, you follow the order of operations, which includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Order of Operations:**\n",
      "1. First, do operations inside grouping symbols like parentheses.\n",
      "Example: \\(3(12 - 5) = 3(7) = 21\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Next, evaluate exponents and roots before other operations.\n",
      "Example: \\(12 - 3^2 = 12 - 9 = 3\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Then, perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.\n",
      "Example: \\(4 + 20 ÷ 2 * 5 = 4 + 10 * 5 = 4 + 50 = 54\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lastly, do addition and subtraction. You can change the order to make it easier.\n",
      "Example: \\(53 + 14 + 7 = 53 + 7 + 14 = 60 + 14 = 74\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rules of Integers:**\n",
      "1. Adding two integers:\n",
      "   - When the signs are the same, add and keep the sign.\n",
      "   - When the signs are different, subtract and keep the sign of the larger number.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Subtracting two integers:\n",
      "   Change subtraction to addition of the opposite number.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Multiplying integers:\n",
      "   - Two negatives make a positive.\n",
      "   - Two positives multiply to a positive.\n",
      "   - A positive and a negative multiply to a negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Dividing integers follows the same rules as multiplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Absolute value is the distance from zero and is always positive.\n",
      "Example: \\(|5| = 5\\); \\(|-3| = 3\\); \\(|0| = 0\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Practice Problems:**\n",
      "1. \\(27 ÷ 3 * 2 = 18\\)\n",
      "2. \\(17 - 15 + 13 = 15\\)\n",

In a given mathematical expression, the order in which we carry out a calculation is important. The wrong order of operations will often lead to the wrong answer. For example, consider the expression \\[4\\div5+6\\times2.\\] We can see that the result is very different when we perform the operations in a different order. BODMAS is an acronym which tells us the correct order in which we should carry out mathematical operations: Division and multiplication, and addition and subtraction, have the same priority - the convention is to work from left to right when the order of operations would be unclear. Note: An alternative form of this mnemonic is BIDMAS, where the I stands for indices. PEMDAS (“Parentheses, exponents, ...”) and BEDMAS are also used in the USA and Australia. Returning to the above example, the correct answer would be the first answer as it follows the rules of BODMAS: division can be done before multiplication and must be done before addition, and multiplication comes before addition. So the answer is $12.8$. We will now look at more examples to practice using BODMAS. Evaluate the following expression: $20\\times(100+1)$. Applying the BODMAS rule, we know that we must first consider everything inside the brackets. Since the only operation inside the brackets is a single sum, we first add $1$ to $100$ to get $101$. The expression then becomes: \\[20\\times101\\]. All that is left is to multiply the two numbers together. This gives $2020$ and so we have: \\[20\\times(100+1)=2020\\]. Evaluate the following expression: $(-4)\\times102$. First notice that although this expression contains a pair of brackets, the brackets are only there to indicate that $-4$ is a negative number. Applying the BODMAS rule, we must first evaluate the exponent: $10^2=100$. Finally, we multiply $100$ by $(-4)$ to get $-400$. We thus have \\[(-4)\\times10^2=-400\\] Evaluate $2+4\\times3-1$ Applying BODMAS, we do the multiplication first. $3\\times4=12$ so we have: \\[2+12-1\\] Then addition and subtraction have the same priority, so we can do either next. Performing the addition first we have: \\[14-1=13.\\] Check for yourself that doing the subtraction before the addition gives the same answer. Evaluate $3+2^2$ Applying BODMAS, we evaluate the power first, then the addition. $2^2=4$ so we have: \\[3+4=7.\\] Try our Numbas test: Arithmetic operations</td>\n",

In a given mathematical expression, the order in which we carry out a calculation is important. The wrong order of operations will often lead to the wrong answer. For example, consider the expression \\[4\\div5+6\\times2.\\] We can see that the result is very different when we perform the operations in a different order. BODMAS is an acronym which tells us the correct order in which we should carry out mathematical operations: Division and multiplication, and addition and subtraction, have the same priority - the convention is to work from left to right when the order of operations would be unclear. Note: An alternative form of this mnemonic is BIDMAS, where the I stands for indices. PEMDAS (“Parentheses, exponents, ...”) and BEDMAS are also used in the USA and Australia. Returning to the above example, the correct answer would be the first answer as it follows the rules of BODMAS: division can be done before multiplication and must be done before addition, and multiplication comes before addition. So the answer is $12.8$. We will now look at more examples to practice using BODMAS. Evaluate the following expression: $20\\times(100+1)$. Applying the BODMAS rule, we know that we must first consider everything inside the brackets. Since the only operation inside the brackets is a single sum, we first add $1$ to $100$ to get $101$. The expression then becomes: \\[20\\times101\\]. All that is left is to multiply the two numbers together. This gives $2020$ and so we have: \\[20\\times(100+1)=2020\\]. Evaluate the following expression: $(-4)\\times102$. First notice that although this expression contains a pair of brackets, the brackets are only there to indicate that $-4$ is a negative number. Applying the BODMAS rule, we must first evaluate the exponent: $10^2=100$. Finally, we multiply $100$ by $(-4)$ to get $-400$. We thus have \\[(-4)\\times10^2=-400\\] Evaluate $2+4\\times3-1$ Applying BODMAS, we do the multiplication first. $3\\times4=12$ so we have: \\[2+12-1\\] Then addition and subtraction have the same priority, so we can do either next. Performing the addition first we have: \\[14-1=13.\\] Check for yourself that doing the subtraction before the addition gives the same answer. Evaluate $3+2^2$ Applying BODMAS, we evaluate the power first, then the addition. $2^2=4$ so we have: \\[3+4=7.\\] Try our Numbas test: Arithmetic operations  \n",

When you perform math operations on integers, you follow the order of operations, which includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\\n\\n**Order of Operations:**\\n1. First, do operations inside grouping symbols like parentheses.\\nExample: \\(3(12 - 5) = 3(7) = 21\\)\\n\\n2. Next, evaluate exponents and roots before other operations.\\nExample: \\(12 - 3^2 = 12 - 9 = 3\\)\\n\\n3. Then, perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.\\nExample: \\(4 + 20 ÷ 2 * 5 = 4 + 10 * 5 = 4 + 50 = 54\\)\\n\\n4. Lastly, do addition and subtraction. You can change the order to make it easier.\\nExample: \\(53 + 14 + 7 = 53 + 7 + 14 = 60 + 14 = 74\\)\\n\\n**Rules of Integers:**\\n1. Adding two integers:\\n   - When the signs are the same, add and keep the sign.\\n   - When the signs are different, subtract and keep the sign of the larger number.\\n\\n2. Subtracting two integers:\\n   Change subtraction to addition of the opposite number.\\n\\n3. Multiplying integers:\\n   - Two negatives make a positive.\\n   - Two positives multiply to a positive.\\n   - A positive and a negative multiply to a negative.\\n\\n4.

When you perform math operations on integers, you follow the order of operations, which includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\\n\\n**Order of Operations:**\\n1. First, do operations inside grouping symbols like parentheses.\\nExample: \\(3(12 - 5) = 3(7) = 21\\)\\n\\n2. Next, evaluate exponents and roots before other operations.\\nExample: \\(12 - 3^2 = 12 - 9 = 3\\)\\n\\n3. Then, perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.\\nExample: \\(4 + 20 ÷ 2 * 5 = 4 + 10 * 5 = 4 + 50 = 54\\)\\n\\n4. Lastly, do addition and subtraction. You can change the order to make it easier.\\nExample: \\(53 + 14 + 7 = 53 + 7 + 14 = 60 + 14 = 74\\)\\n\\n**Rules of Integers:**\\n1. Adding two integers:\\n   - When the signs are the same, add and keep the sign.\\n   - When the signs are different, subtract and keep the sign of the larger number.\\n\\n2. Subtracting two integers:\\n   Change subtraction to addition of the opposite number.\\n\\n3. Multiplying integers:\\n   - Two negatives make a positive.\\n   - Two positives multiply to a positive.\\n   - A positive and a negative multiply to a negative.\\n\\n4. Dividing integers follows the same rules as multiplication.\\n\\n5. Absolute value is the distance from zero and is always positive.\\nExample: \\(|5| = 5\\); \\(|-3| = 3\\); \\(|0| = 0\\)\\n\\n**Practice Problems:**\\n1. \\(27 ÷ 3 * 2 = 18\\)\\n2. \\(17 - 15 + 13 = 15\\)\\n3. \\(-4(5 - 3)^2 - 12 = -28\\)\\n4. \\(2|5 - 9| = 8\\)\\n5. \\(\\sqrt{9} + 16 = 5\\)\\n\\nBy following the order of operations and these integer rules, you can solve math problems involving integers step by step.  \n",

two negative numbers together, the result is always a positive number. This rule applies to integers and is a fundamental property of multiplication.\\n\\nFor example:\\n(-3) x (-4) = 12\\n(-2) x (-6) = 12\\n\\nSo, when you multiply two negative numbers, the product will be a positive number.  \n",

concept regarding the order of operations in mathematics. However, there is a slight variation between the two:\\n\\n**PEMDAS** stands for:\\n1. **Parentheses**\\n2. **Exponents**\\n3. **Multiplication** (from left to right)\\n4. **Division** (from left to right)\\n5. **Addition** (from left to right)\\n6. **Subtraction** (from left to right)\\n\\n**BODMAS** stands for:\\n1. **Brackets** (or Parentheses)\\n2. **Orders** (or Exponents)\\n3. **Division** (from left to right)\\n4. **Multiplication** (from left to right)\\n5. **Addition** (from left to right)\\n6. **Subtraction** (from left to right)\\n\\nThe primary difference between PEMDAS and BODMAS is the order of multiplication and division. In PEMDAS, multiplication and division are given equal priority and are performed from left to right. In BODMAS, division takes precedence over multiplication and is performed before multiplication from left to right.\\n\\nIn practice, both PEMDAS and BODMAS serve as guidelines for ensuring that mathematical expressions are computed consistently and accurately by following a standardized order of operations.  \n",

                  In real-world scenarios and mathematical practice, the PEMDAS rule is more commonly used and referenced in the United States and many other countries. The PEMDAS rule is a widely recognized acronym that helps students and professionals remember the correct order of operations when solving mathematical expressions.\\n\\nHowever, it's essential to note that the principles behind PEMDAS and BODMAS are essentially the same and both serve the purpose of ensuring consistent and accurate computation of mathematical expressions. The priority of operations remains consistent in both PEMDAS and BODMAS, with the main difference being the order of multiplication and division.  \n",

Here is a summary of our discussion:\\n\\n**Key Points Discussed:**\\n1. **Integers:** Integers are positive and negative whole numbers.\\n2. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** The order of operations guides the sequence in which mathematical calculations are performed: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.\\n3. **Multiplying Integers:** When multiplying integers, the rules determine the sign of the product: two positives result in a positive, two negatives result in a positive, and a positive and a negative result in a negative.\\n4. **PEMDAS vs. BODMAS:** Both acronyms represent the same order of operations, with a slight variation in the order of multiplication and division.\\n5. **Real-World Application:** The PEMDAS rule is more commonly used in real-world scenarios and mathematical practice.\\n\\n**Math Problem Solved:**\\nWe solved the math expression: (8*9) - 8/4 + 6*5. The step-by-step approach involved:\\n1. Multiplying 8 by 9 to get 72.\\n2. Multiplying 6 by 5 to get 30.\\n3. Dividing 8 by 4 to get 2.\\n4. Substituting the results back into the expression and calculating to get the final answer of 100.\\n\\n**Main Insights Gained:**\\n1. Understanding the importance of following the order of operations when solving mathematical expressions.\\n2. Recognizing the rules for multiplying integers to determine the sign of the product.\\n3. Differentiating between PEMDAS and BODMAS for order of operations, highlighting the commonality and slight variation.\\n4. Acknowledging the practical application of mathematical rules like PEMDAS in real-world scenarios for accurate calculations.\\n\\nBy delving into these mathematical concepts and applying problem-solving strategies, we reinforced the importance of following rules and guidelines to arrive at correct mathematical solutions efficiently.
